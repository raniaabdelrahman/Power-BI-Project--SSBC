# Power-BI-Project--Create a Data Model for Seven Sages Brewing Company

**Project Overview**

In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. Your data model will allow the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which generate the highest profitability.

In the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize previously siloed data, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. The core principles remain the same regardless of how large the data models get as your career progresses.

**Main Steps**

Here are the main steps. We'll go over each of these in more detail on the pages that follow.

Source files. Download and familiarize yourself with the source files provided by SSBC.
Sketch the data model. Sketch out the data model you intend to build.
Use Get Data. Use Get Data to load the data from the starter materials into Power BI.
Structure, combine, and clean the data. Clean and format your data so that it will work well in your data model.
Create your date table. Create a date table to support time intelligence.
Build relationships between your tables. Build a relationship from each dimension to the relevant key on the fact table.
Write your measures. To satisfy the CFO's requirements, we will need to write six measuresâ€”to calculate Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies.
Create a report. Build a basic visual report to display your findings.
The steps for this project follow the exact same flow we've been looking at throughout this course:
